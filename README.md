What is this?
-------------

A small utility script that follows [this procedure](http://www.garth.org/archives/2011,08,27,169,fix-time-machine-sparsebundle-nas-based-backup-errors.html).
Works OK mostly but I accept no responsibility for lost data or lost anything caused by this script.

*Needs more testing!*
